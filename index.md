## MyAIGuide

MyAIGuide aims to create personal health recommendations systems based on AI to help all patients better manage their health. As a first step, we chose to focus on patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome and other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain.

## Studying patellofemoral pain syndrome and other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain

For patients suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome and other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, finding the right balance between rest and exercise is a difficult yet very important problem, mostly ignored by the medical community. In order to help patients optimize their recovery and/or their pain management, we aim to create personalized AI recommandations systems to help them make better choices regarding the amount of rest and exercise they get.

## Results so far

From 2017 to 2021, we collected data about pain, exercise and other variables (such as stress levels, mood, sleep, etc...) from patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome and other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain through a dedicated web app. The data collected through this web app is now open-source on Github and some code to visualize and analyze this data is already available.
